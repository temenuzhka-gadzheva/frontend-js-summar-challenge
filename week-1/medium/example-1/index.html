                on the Internet, television, and places such as
                school and the workplace can be discourteous to each
                other. For example, if you watch videos online, there is
                always a troll in the comments section being extremely
                rude to others or not expressing their opinion in a
                well-mannered way. The way these trolls behave is dirsre-spectiful
                and they cause disharmony in the online com-munity
                in which they are participating.

                I feel it is important to respect people, even people you
                might not particularly like. Not being respectful can
                show that you have poor character, are closed-minded.
