                    Tokyo Tower, like the Eiffel Tower in Paris, is the <strong>symbol</strong>
                    of the Japanese metropolis for which it receives its name. Over 150
                    million <strong>people</strong> have visited <strong>Tokyo Tower</strong> since the opening in
                    1958. Tokyo Tower is painted <strong>international</strong> orange and white
                    which is <strong>required</strong> by the <strong>Japane</strong>
                    air safety <strong>regulations</strong>.Tokyo
                    Tower is the <strong>second</strong> tallest
                    <strong>structure</strong> in Japan next to Tokyo
                    Skytree.

                    In 1958, <strong>building</strong> was completed
                    by Japan's oldest <strong>contruction</strong>
                    company, <strong>Takenaka</strong> Corporation, and was
                    <strong>opened</strong> to the public
                    for the <strong>first time</strong>
                    as a radio and television broadcasting tower. The
                    project was conceived by <strong>Nihon Denpato</strong>(Nippon Television City Corp.)
                    and was <strong>originally</strong>
                    planned to be taller than the <strong>Empire State</strong>
                    Building, which was the tallest building in the world at the
                    time. Due to a lack of <strong>funding</strong>
                    and <strong> materials</strong>, they changed the
                    height to meet the <strong>minimum</strong>
                    requirements for broadcasting TV
                    signals through the <strong>Kanto</strong>
                    region.
